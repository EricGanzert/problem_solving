Checks whether c is an alphabetic letter.

Notice that what is considered a letter depends on the locale being used; In the default "C" locale, what constitutes a letter is only what returns true by either isupper or islower.

Using other locales, an alphabetic character is a character for which isupper or islower would return true, or another character explicitly considered alphabetic by the locale (in this case, the character cannot be iscntrl, isdigit, ispunct or isspace).

For a detailed chart on what the different ctype functions return for each character of the standard ANSII character set, see the reference for the <cctype> header.

In C++, a locale-specific template version of this function (isalpha) exists in header <locale>.
